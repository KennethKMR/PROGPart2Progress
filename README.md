So the program has changed alot due to the fact that i ran into some errors when trying to build on my previous code.
That resulted in me having to take a different approach to how will look, and how the output would look.
Without a further ado, here are the step-by-step ways to use my program.
So, when the user runs the program they are greeted with a interface.
This interface allows the user to:
-Enter a new recipe
-Display all recipes that have been created
-Display a recipe of their choice
-Scale their recipe
-Clear all recipes
-Close the program

That is an accurate representation of what the user has access to.
When the user wishes to create a recipe, they will be prompted to enter the name of the recipe.
Following that, the user will then be prompted to enter the amount of ingredients that the recipe needs.
Then the user will have to give a name to each of the ingredients, but if the user stated that they needed more than 1 ingredient, then this promp will only come back once the user has entered the following information:
-The quantity of that specific ingredient
-The unit of measurement when considering the amount of that ingredient
-The amount of calories that the ingredient consists of
-The type of food group the ingredient belongs to

Then the user will be prompted to enter the amount of steps that are required to fullfill the recipe.
The user will then have to describe each step.
Once they have done that, their recipe will be temporarily saved to the system.(it will be wiped if the application gets closed)

The second feature the application has is to display all the recipes entered back to the user.
If there was no recipe entry before, the user will be notified that no recipe exists.

The third feature the application has is to display any recipe the user wants.
They will get a notification saying that no recipe exists if there was no prior recipe entry.
But if other recipes have been entered, they will have the option to choose which recipe gets displayed by entering corresponding number that forms part of each recipe.

The fourth feature allows the user to scale the ingredients values based on what the user enters.
The user has the options between "0,5", or "2", or "3"
the first divides the values by half, the second doubles it, and the third triples it.
Once the user does this, it wont be displayed back to them, but the changes will be made to the recipe being stored.

THe fifth feature allows the user to clear all the recipes, essentially wiping every recipe from the system.

And then the final feature allows the user to close the program.
